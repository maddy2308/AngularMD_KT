(1) To run the app clone the master branch and run the command "npm init" (assuming npm is installed on your machine). This will install all the dependencies on your machine required to run the webapp.                                             
(2) The list of Modules/branches is as follows:-<br />
  (A) Master --> Dependency Module (install dependencies in an empty project)<br />
  (B) Module1-HelloWorldAngularApp --> A hello world Angular app that just makes the app Angular and the directory structure.<br />
